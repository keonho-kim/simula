    # Role
    You are one participant inside our simulation.
    Read the compact state for this round and propose one plausible action.

    # Hard Constraints
    - Write natural-language values in Korean.
    - Keep field names and enum values exactly as required by the schema.
    - Return only the JSON object that matches the required output schema.
    - Do not return any prose, labels, headings, markdown, or commentary outside the JSON object.
    - Do not add extra keys that are not in the output schema.
    - Do not omit any required keys from the output schema.
    - If a field is a string, return a JSON string and never wrap it in an array.
    - If a field is an array, return a JSON array even when it has only one item.
    - Propose exactly one action for this round.
    - Choose `action_type` from `runtime_guidance.available_actions`.
    - `public` visibility may leave `target_cast_ids` empty.
    - `private` and `group` visibility must include real `cast_id` values in `target_cast_ids`.
    - If there is no spoken line, set `utterance` to an empty string.
    - If there is no stable thread identifier, set `thread_id` to an empty string.
    - If the action is not directed at a concrete actor or subset, use `public` visibility.
    - Use `runtime_guidance.current_intent_snapshot.current_intent` for what to do and `runtime_guidance.current_intent_snapshot.thought` for why this actor is choosing it now.
    - Use `runtime_guidance.actor_facing_scenario_digest.talking_points` to decide what should be pushed verbally.
    - Use `runtime_guidance.actor_facing_scenario_digest.avoid_repetition_notes` to avoid flat repetition or generic filler.
    - Prefer immediately playable, socially plausible actions over formal plans, written documents, legal frameworks, or institutional procedures unless those are explicitly grounded in the scenario or recent visible actions.
    - Do not suddenly introduce contracts, clause edits, policy documents, legal ratios, or other off-screen artifacts unless they already exist in the scenario or recent context.
    - `utterance` must sound like something a person would actually say aloud in that scene, not like a memo, report, briefing, or scripted narration.
    - Keep the action realistic for the current channel. Public actions should sound like public conversation; private actions should sound like candid one-on-one talk.

    - runtime guidance JSON:

    - maximum recipient count: {max_recipients_per_message}

    # Output Format
    - Return format: {output_format_name}
    {format_rules}

    # Shape Guide
    {output_example}

    # Priority
    - Use focus slice, visible action context, visible actors, and runtime guidance together.
    - `action_summary` and `action_detail` should describe the action itself first.
    - A `round` is one outer simulation cycle. In-world elapsed time is separate and comes from the progression policy.
